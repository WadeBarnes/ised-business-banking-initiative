  <h2>Verified Relationship Credential</h2>
  <p>For this Proof of Concept, you will now receive a &quot;relationship&quot; credential. This will allow you to prove a relationship between you (via your &quot;person&quot; credential) and your organization (via your &quot;organization&quot; credential).</p>
  <p>Once again, the User Experience is not as all as it would be in a real production use case. Properly, this additional credential should be automatically offered to you immediately after you collected your Verified Organizational credential. Nothing to click, no QR code to scan&mdash;just a popup in your wallet app for you to confirm that you want the credential.</p>
  <p>For this PoC service we will use the same &quot;proof, complete form, get credential&quot; flow we've used for the other two credentials. In this case, you will be asked to prove data from both of the credentials you have, and be presented with a form containing the information that will be issued in your &quot;Verified Relationship&quot; credential.</p>
  <p>Once the verification process is complete, you will be on a form to collect information about the you, the organization and the relationship between the two. Much of it will be complete based on data from the proven credentials and generated data, with a couple of fields for you to complete. Once done and submitted, you will see the now way too familiar QR code.</p>
  <p>Let the scanning begin!</p>
