	<ol>
		<li>Two of the following: passport, drivers license, BC services card, birth certificate</li>
		<li>Full registration paperwork for your organization, including all incorporation documents</li>
		<li><em>[Additional onerous requirements]</em></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Photocopies are not allowed, but we will need to make copies of all accepted documents.</p>
	<p>Please note that in some cases we may request additional information to complete the process, such as a signed letter from your organization's directors confirming your ability to open an account.</p>
	<h4>Option 2: Instant Digital Verification</h4>
	<p>For those who hold Verifiable Credentials you can open an account <strong>immediately</strong>. You simply need to present the personal and organization credentials in your digital wallet.</p>
	<p>The process should take less than 5 minutes.</
